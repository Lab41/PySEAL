# Introduction
Simple Encrypted Arithmetic Library - SEAL is an easy-to-use homomorphic encryption library, developed by researchers in the Cryptography 
Research group at Microsoft Research. SEAL is written in C++11, and contains .NET wrappers for the 
public API. It has no external dependencies.

# Documentation
The code-base contains examples written both in C++ and in C#. These examples are heavily commented, 
serving as a self-contained short introduction to using the library. In addition, the .h files both 
in the C++ library and in the .NET wrapper library contain detailed comments for the public API.

To learn to use SEAL, we recommend looking at the example projects, as they contain several detailed 
and thoroughly commented examples demonstrating most of the basic features.

A detailed manual for using the newest version of SEAL is available 
[here](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/simple-encrypted-arithmetic-library-seal-v2-2/).
